DATASET INFORMATION:
  • Total Passengers: 891
  • Features Used: 21
  • Training Samples: 712
  • Testing Samples: 179

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
  Random Forest:
    - Training Accuracy: 91.15%
    - Testing Accuracy:  81.56%
    - AUC Score:         0.8315
    
  Decision Tree:
    - Training Accuracy: 91.57%
    - Testing Accuracy:  81.01%
    - AUC Score:         0.8255

BEST MODEL: Random Forest
  
TOP 5 IMPORTANT FEATURES:
  2. Sex: 0.1856
  6. Fare: 0.1445
  12. Title_Mr: 0.1398
  3. Age: 0.1107
  1. Pclass: 0.0910

KEY INSIGHTS:
  • Gender was the most important predictor
  • Passenger class significantly affected survival
  • Family size and being alone also played important roles
  • Random Forest performed better than Decision Tree

NEXT STEPS:
  1. Try hyperparameter tuning
  2. Experiment with other algorithms (XGBoost, SVM)
  3. Create ensemble models
  4. Deploy model as a web app
